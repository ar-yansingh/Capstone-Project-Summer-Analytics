# Capstone Project: Dynamic Pricing Prediction for Parking

## Overview

This project implements a **predictive pricing system** for parking lots using historical and time-based data. Developed entirely in **Google Colab**, it combines structured preprocessing, multiple modeling techniques, and rich visual analytics. The project explores two pricing models — one baseline and one context-aware — for improving revenue predictability and operational decisions.

## Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

- Mounted Google Drive for file access
- Cleaned timestamps, missing values, and encoded vehicle and lot-level variables
- Mapped numeric weights to variables like `VehicleType`, `TrafficCondition`, etc.

## Pricing Models

### Model 1: Historical Average Pricing

A baseline model that predicts prices using historical averages or medians for each lot and hour segment.

```python
Price = base_price + α * (avg_occupancy) + β * vehicle_weight
```

Pros:
- Simple and fast  
Cons:
- Ignores real-time context like traffic or demand spikes

### Model 2: Context-Aware Dynamic Model

Incorporates temporal and environmental variables such as occupancy ratio, time of day, and vehicle type.

```python
Price = BASE + α * (Occupancy / Capacity)
              + β * TimeWeight
              + γ * VehicleWeight
              + δ * IsWeekend
```

Pros:
- Responds to real-time behavior and context  
Cons:
- Needs more preprocessing and tuning

## Pathway Integration

- **Used for**: Organizing output directories (`/notebooks/visuals`), managing filepaths, and controlling runtime storage
- **Tool**: `pathlib.Path` and Colab drive mount
- **Benefit**: Clean reproducible structure, enabling consistent saving of plots, processed data, and outputs
